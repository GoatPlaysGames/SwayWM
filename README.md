I Reccomened moving the install script to you $HOME directory before begginning.
You will have to make the file executable using "sudo chmod +x install_config.sh"
When you run it you may have to run it as root (sudo), please take the normal precautions of looking through the install script and through each config file within this directory. There is no malicious code in here, but it is good practice when going through and running random bash scripts and install scripts.

# Install
sudo chmod +x install_config.sh
# This must be ran as sudo as it is using pacman to install things. If you are on a different linux distro this will curreently not work.
sudo /.install_config.sh
